This document provides a detailed assembly guide for the plate handler (also known as the claw).

This assembly guide assumes all required components have been acquired and all 3D-printed parts from the 'CAD' folder are complete.

2A) Then one M3 x 8 mm hex socket button screw was inserted through the front of each of the holes of the front main body and tightened up (Becareful not to overtighten else the screw extends further than the bracket and you risk scratching the OT-2 gantry!)

4) Then one M3 x 6 mm hex socket button screw was inserted from the back of each of the holes in the support bracket and a M3 square nut was loosely fit. This was then slid up the OT-2's gantry via the rails (Note remove the small screw if situated by the red arrow as this will prevent the fitting)
