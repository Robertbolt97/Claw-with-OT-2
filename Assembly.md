This document provides a detailed assembly guide for the plate handler (also known as the claw).

This assembly guide assumes all required components have been acquired and all 3D-printed parts from the 'CAD' folder are complete.

* *Top body (Verical movement)* *

1) The support brackets were slid into place on the front main body
   
   ![Step 1](Images/Step_1.jpg)

2) The support bracket braces were then placed overthem prefitted with M3 square nuts push fitted in
   
   ![Step 2](Images/Step_2.jpg)

2A) Then one M3 x 8 mm hex socket button screw was inserted through the front of each of the holes of the front main body and tightened up (Becareful not to overtighten else the screw extends further than the bracket and you risk scratching the OT-2 gantry!)

3) The servo motor is then attached to the lowering arm gear and subsequently screwed into postions

4) Then one M3 x 6 mm hex socket button screw was inserted from the back of each of the holes in the support bracket and a M3 square nut was loosely fit. This was then slid up the OT-2's gantry via the rails (Note remove the small screw if situated by the red arrow as this will prevent the fitting)

4A) The top body was then slid up the gantry until it was approximately 5 cm from the base of the gantry. The screws were then tightened up.

This is the completion of the top body.

* *Bottom body (Horizontal movement)* *

8) The front slider was then attached using the seld-tapping screws (2.9 mm x 9.5 mm)

   ![Step 8](Images/Step_8.jpg)

9) The sliding fork reinforce's were then added by sliding them into place <ins>AT THE SAME TIME</ins>.

10) The stopper was then push fitted into position

    ![Step 10](Images/Step_10.jpg)

This is the completion of the bottom body.
